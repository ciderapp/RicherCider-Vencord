`Vencord/src/plugins/`

In this folder, **copy** the file named **richerCider.desktop.tsx**.

### Installing

To install your customised version of Vencord, run the following three commands:

`pnpm install`<br>
`pnpm build`<br>
`pnpm inject`<br>

Next, use the launched Vencord installer to inject your Discord installation.
